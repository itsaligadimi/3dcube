# OpenGLES example on Android
This is an example of how to use OpenGL on android in a very basic level. I don't know if it's the standard way of doing things but it might give you an idea of how things work.
By the way, sorry it's a little messy. Got Bored at the end!!! (:D)

## Features!
  - using GLSurfaceView
  - parsing wavefront(.obj) files
  - drawing each face separately with GL_LINE_LOOP
  - rotating models (basic implementation)

##### TODO!
  - improve rotation
  - implement zooming

There aren't much easy tutorials about opengl out there and it's not easy grasp the how it works. So, I don't know, if you think you can use this to make some good content, feel free to do it or let's do it together :)
